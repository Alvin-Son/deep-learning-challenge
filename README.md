# Alphabet Soup Fund Success Predictor

## Project Overview
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, seeks a tool to help select applicants for funding who have the best chance of success in their ventures. Using machine learning and neural networks, this project aims to create a binary classifier that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains over 34,000 records of organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **EIN**: Identification number of the organization
- **NAME**: Name of the organization
- **APPLICATION_TYPE**: Type of application submitted to Alphabet Soup
- **AFFILIATION**: Sector of industry the organization is affiliated with
- **CLASSIFICATION**: Government organization classification
- **USE_CASE**: Use case for the funding
- **ORGANIZATION**: Type of organization
- **STATUS**: Active status of the organization
- **INCOME_AMT**: Income classification of the organization
- **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**: Special considerations for the application
- **ASK_AMT**: Amount of funding requested
- **IS_SUCCESSFUL**: Indicator of whether the funding was used effectively

## Objective
The goal is to use the features in the dataset to build a model that can accurately predict the `IS_SUCCESSFUL` outcome, indicating whether an organization's funding request will lead to a successful outcome.

## Requirements
- Utilize machine learning and neural network techniques to create a binary classifier.
- Analyze and preprocess the provided dataset to prepare it for model training.
- Train and evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and clean the data.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Build and train a neural network model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters.
   - Implement techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Save the trained model.
   - Create a user-friendly interface to make predictions on new data.

## Usage
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the CSV file containing the dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data as described.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the neural network model on the preprocessed data.
4. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
